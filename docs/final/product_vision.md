# Streat Feast â€” Product Vision

## 1. Product Summary
**Streat Feast** is a minimalistic, fast, and beginner-friendly restaurant management system designed for small food outlets and kitchens. It enables the **Admin (desktop)** to manage menus and create orders, and the **Chef and Waiter (Android)** to manage food preparation and delivery flow â€” all in real time via Firebase.

The system replaces complex POS and restaurant tools with a lightweight, offline-capable, intuitive interface that prioritizes speed, clarity, and ease of use.

## 2. Problem Statement
Most restaurant POS systems are heavy, expensive, and require training. Small businesses often struggle with:
- Overloaded interfaces with too many options.
- Reliance on paid APIs or SaaS.
- Poor support for offline or low-internet environments.
- Lack of coordination between kitchen and front staff.

**Streat Feast** solves this by providing an ultra-simplified, free, and clear flow for the order lifecycle.
