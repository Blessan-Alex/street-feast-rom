We need to make some ui ux changes 
**Application UI/UX Requirements**

**1. Data Loading**

- Data loading should be mandatory and rigid to ensure consistency.(should not navigate to other pages , only adding menu for first time user)
by this we mean that for the first time user , after loging in it menu should come for the first time , there should be only one card saying Uplod menu, then after clicking that floating cards two should open up saying upload manually or import file , while this is happening the user should not be able to naviagte the other screens becasue menu uploading is the first and foremost thing, after it is done then normal , frits time user can be identified as if menu is not loaded

**2. Default Page**

- After loading, the “Create Order” page should be set as the default landing page. this is for existing user(if menu is loaded already)

**3. Header**

- Remove “Street Feast Admin” text from the header.
- Add breadcrumbs in the header to display the file pathway/navigation trail. It should show minimally wehre we are , [create order, category name], etc etc

**4. Navigation Panel**

- Move the Logout option to the side navigation panel (bottom). 
- The side navigation panel should be shrinkable/collapsible for better usability.

**5. Item Card**

- Each item card should include an “Add” button.(remove plus minus from order summary)

**6. Item Addition Flow (Chronology)**
We are changing how each item works , 

1. Add Button/icon →
after this ,each should be like floating windows sepearate
2. Enter Quantity (large, small, 8 12 extra large etc etc) if item doesnt have then avoid this→
3. Chef Tip (includes text input with suggestion text) →
4. Select Number of Items →
5. Place Order(one by one)

**7. Order Summary**

- All items in the order summary should be editable(insteaf of + or - add edit ).
edit should lead to same kind of item adding flaoting window as above
- Each item should have a cross (×) icon on the top-right corner to delete the order.
- The rest of the layout and information should remain the same.

**8. Order Confirmation**

- Both confirmation and cancellation actions should appear after a confirmation alert.(pop up)(this is when placing an order or cancelling an order)

**9. Search Functionality**

- Add a search icon inside the search bar.

**10. Menu Interface**

- The Menu Interface should visually match the “Create Order” page.(like in figma)
- It should include the following buttons and functionalities:
    - Add More – to add more categories(top right)
    - Delete Categories – to remove categories(bottom left)
    - Save Changes – to save updates(bottom right)
- 
- Each category should include:
    - Edit/View Button – to edit or view the category and its items
