## Data Structures

### Order Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string (uuid),
  orderNumber: number (sequential),
  type: 'DineIn' | 'Parcel' | 'Delivery',
  chefTip: string,
  status: OrderStatus,
  createdAt: number (timestamp),
  updatedAt: number (timestamp),
  orderItems: OrderItem[]
}
```

### Order Item (with Snapshots)
```typescript
{
  id: string (uuid),
  itemId: string (reference),
  nameSnapshot: string,        // SNAPSHOT: won't change
  size: 'Small' | 'Large' | null,
  vegFlagSnapshot: 'Veg' | 'NonVeg',  // SNAPSHOT: historical
  qty: number (min: 1)
}
```

### Allowed Status Transitions
```
Created   → [Accepted, Canceled]
Accepted  → [InKitchen, Canceled]
InKitchen → [Prepared, Canceled]
Prepared  → [Delivered]
Delivered → [Closed]
Closed    → []
Canceled  → []
```

---

## Color Palette (Status Colors)

Applied throughout UI for consistency:

- **Created:** `#3B82F6` (Blue)
- **Accepted:** `#F97316` (Orange)
- **InKitchen:** `#EAB308` (Yellow)
- **Prepared:** `#22C55E` (Green)
- **Delivered:** `#A855F7` (Purple)
- **Closed:** `#6B7280` (Gray)
- **Canceled:** `#EF4444` (Red)

---

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Snapshot Pattern
Menu items are copied (not referenced) into order lines, preventing future menu changes from affecting historical orders.

### 2. Single Source of Truth
Status transitions defined once in ordersStore, all UI components query `getAllowedTransitions()`.

### 3. Optimistic Updates
Status changes apply immediately in UI, relying on Zustand's reactivity.

### 4. Debouncing
Search input debounced to 250ms to prevent excessive filtering.

### 5. Two-Step Confirmation
Critical actions (Cancel Order, Delete All Data) require double confirmation.

### 6. Proper Cleanup
All Zustand subscriptions use `isActive` flag for HMR safety.

## localStorage Keys Used

```
sf.user                  - Auth user data
sf.categories           - Menu categories
sf.items                - Menu items
sf.frequentItemIds      - Frequent bought IDs
sf.orders               - All orders array
sf.draft                - Current draft order
sf.order.counter        - Sequential order number counter
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test all features thoroughly
2. Fix any edge cases discovered
3. Verify persistence across app restarts

### Day 3 Preparation
1. Review Android app requirements
2. Plan waiter app interface
3. Plan chef app interface
4. Consider shared data sync strategy

### Day 4 Preparation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Snapshot Pattern is Critical:** Prevents menu changes from affecting historical orders
2. **Single Source of Truth:** Transitions map in store prevents UI bugs
3. **Debouncing is Essential:** Search without debouncing causes performance issues
4. **Two-Step Confirmation:** Prevents accidental data loss
5. **Proper Cleanup:** isActive flag prevents HMR duplicate subscriptions
6. **Type Safety:** TypeScript caught multiple potential runtime errors
7. **Component Reusability:** Button, Dialog, Toast saved significant time
